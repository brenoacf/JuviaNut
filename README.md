# JuviaNut
JuviaNut is an attempt to develop software for testing WEB applications.

Its concept is based on an XML file that is read and interpreted to generate another Python program to execute routines through the Selenium library. This way, people who do not have specific knowledge of using the language and library can use this program to automate their WEB application testing.

The name Juvia was used in reference to Brazil nuts, which are one of the foods richest in the element selenium. Juvia is the indigenous way this chestnut is called in Amazonia.
